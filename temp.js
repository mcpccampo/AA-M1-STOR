// Write a function `repeatingTranslate` that accepts a sentence as an argument.
// It should translate the sentence according to the following rules:
//
// - words that are shorter than 3 characters are unchanged
// - words that are 3 characters or longer, see rules

//   following rules:

//   - if the word ends with a vowel, simply repeat the word twice (example:
//     'like'->'likelike')

//   - if the word ends with a non-vowel, repeat all letters that come after the
//     word's last vowel, including the last vowel itself (example:
//     'trash'->'trashash')

// Note that if words are capitalized in the original sentence, they should remain
// capitalized in the translated sentence. Vowels are the letters a, e, i, o, u.
